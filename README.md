# TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES 

Structure and organization — Implement an idiomatic and flexible code structure for your RESTful API projects.

JSON responses — Send JSON responses from your API, format and customize them, and catch common gotchas you need to be aware of.

JSON requests —  Parse incoming JSON requests, manage bad requests, and restrict and validate their content.

SQL migrations — Use SQL migrations to manage changes to your database schema.

Database operations — Set timeouts on database queries and optimize the behavior of Go’s sql.DB connection pool.

CRUD — Perform advanced actions on  API resources, including fetching related data and partial updates (with optimistic concurrency control).

Filtering, sorting and pagination —  support filtering, sorting and pagination of data in API endpoints.

Full-text search — Use PostgreSQL’s full-text search functionality to perform natural-language searches of your data.

Structured logging — custom logger which writes structured, leveled, log entries in JSON format.

Rate-limiting — limit requests to  API on a per-client basis.

Managing background tasks — Safely execute tasks in background goroutines.

Graceful shutdown — Set up API to support graceful shutdowns, including waiting for background tasks to complete.

Sending emails — Send emails from your API and manage email content using Go’s new embedded files functionality.

User activation and password resets — Build secure workflows for registering users, verifying their email address, and managing password resets.

Authentication —  authenticate users with both stateful bearers tokens and stateless JWTs (JSON web tokens).

Permission-based authorization —  implement granular permission-based authorization checks on API endpoints.

Managing CORS requests — Control cross-origin requests to your API from front-end JavaScript applications.

Metrics — Expose application metrics, including memory use, sql.DB connection pool statistics, response status counts and more.

Building and auditing — Combine Go’s tooling and Makefiles to easily audit your code, build binaries and vendor dependencies.

Versioning —  leverage Git to apply automatic application versioning when building binaries.
